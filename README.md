## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xMarioOP/glasgow-coma-scale.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd glasgow-coma-scale

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for structure.
- **CSS**  for styling.
- **JavaScript** for logic and real-time score calculations.

## How it Works

The Glasgow Coma Scale is based on three parameters:

1. **Eye Opening Response (E)**
2. **Verbal Response (V)**
3. **Motor Response (M)**

Each parameter is scored on a scale, and the total score ranges from **3** to **15**. This project allows users to input responses in each category, and it calculates the total GCS score and provides a classification.
